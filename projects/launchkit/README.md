![LaunchKit Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Prototype-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## 🎯 Overview

LaunchKit solves the **discoverability crisis** in indie game development. With 900,000+ games on itch.io (2026), even great games drown in the noise. LaunchKit provides the tools and community indie developers need to launch successfully.

### The Problem
- **900K+ games on itch.io** → Massive saturation
- **Godot 4** lowered barrier to entry → More developers, same marketing challenges
- **Solo developers lack marketing experience** → Technical skills ≠ Marketing skills
- **Isolation** → No feedback, no community, no support

### The Solution
**LaunchKit** is a community-driven platform that combines:
1. **Launch Calendar** — Find perfect launch windows, avoid competition
2. **Press Kit Generator** — AI-assisted professional press kits
3. **Peer Review** — Get feedback from fellow developers
4. **Steam Optimizer** — Data-driven store page optimization

## 📊 PDCA Score: 8.70/10

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Plan** (26.0/30): Strong problem-solution fit, clear target, viable business model
- **Do** (15.5/20): Moderate technical complexity, 4-5 week MVP timeline
- **Check** (22.0/25): Strong differentiation through community network effects
- **Act** (23.5/25): Large market, viral growth potential, sustainable advantage

### Key Strengths
✅ **Community-driven** → Network effects = defensible moat  
✅ **Data accumulation** → Gets better with more users  
✅ **Addresses real pain** → 900K games = real discoverability crisis  
✅ **First-mover** → No dedicated indie launch platform exists  

### Risks & Mitigations
⚠️ **Cold start problem** → Manual onboarding first 100 users  
⚠️ **AI costs** → Tier limits + user pays on Pro tier  
⚠️ **Moderation** → Karma system + community guidelines
