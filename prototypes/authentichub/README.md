# AuthenticHub — Proof of Human Engine

AuthenticHub is a platform designed to verify that digital content is created by a real human, not generated by AI. In the world of 2026, authenticity is the ultimate competitive advantage.

## Concept
As AI content floods every platform, audiences are experiencing "AI fatigue." AuthenticHub solves this by providing a verifiable record of the human creative process (Behind The Scenes - BTS) and linking it directly to the final content.

## Key Features
- **Auto-BTS Capture**: Seamlessly logs creative activity from professional tools (DaVinci, Figma, VS Code, etc.).
- **Proof of Human (PoH) Badge**: A cryptographically signed verification badge for your content.
- **Verified Timelines**: Let your audience explore how you made it, with timestamped evidence of human effort.
- **Integration**: Works with Camera-to-Cloud workflows for instant verification from the lens.

## Prototype
The current prototype demonstrates:
- **Verified Content Dashboard**: Overview of human hours and trust scores.
- **Live BTS Verification Feed**: Real-time logging of creative tools and hardware inputs.
- **Authenticity Metrics**: Tracking how BTS content improves engagement.

## Technical Vision
- **Backend**: Next.js with Edge Functions for fast metadata signing.
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized, immutable proof of activity.
- **Verification**: Biometric PoH + Tool Metadata + Hardware Signatures (Wacom/Mouse movement patterns).
